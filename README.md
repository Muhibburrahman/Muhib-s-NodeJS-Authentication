# Muhib's NodeJS Authentication Project
# Intro: 
Muhib's Node.js authentication project is a web application designed for user authentication processes such as login, sign up, and password reset functionalities. It utilizes a MongoDB database to securely store user information, including encrypted passwords.
# Features: 
1) User Signup: Users can sign up on the website by providing their Name, Email ID, and Password. The entered information is securely stored in the MongoDB database after encryption.
2) User Sign In: Registered users can sign in to the website using their Name and Password credentials. The authentication process verifies the user's details against the encrypted data in the database.
3) Password Reset: Users have the option to reset or change their passwords if needed. To reset the password, users need to provide their Name, old password, and the new password they wish to set. The system ensures the security of password changes by encrypting and updating the new password in the database.
